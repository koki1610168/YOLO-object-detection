# YOLO(You Only Look Once), Object Detection

YOLO is a real-time object detection system. 
These python codes present object detection in static images, videos, and real-time as well.
To enhance accuracy and efficiency, I used pre-trained model provided by [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).
This enables me to train images even on my old mac book.
